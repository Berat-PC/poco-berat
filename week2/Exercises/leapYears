Ex. 3.2.2 (**) 
Write a program that asks the user for a date. 
-> Find the day of the year for the given date. 

For example,
January 1st would be 1, and December 31st is 365.
a) Do not include leap years.
b) Include leap years. Check the rules for leap years on the internet, and implement them in your program.

Leap year calculation : 
 If the year is divisible by four, it's a leap year. 
 But if the year can be divided by 100 as well as four, it's not a leap year. 
 However, if the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.


 a ) 
        Variables 
            inputYear as String ex(march 17);
            dayNr;
            january 1-31 = 0, 
            february 32+28-1 = 32 ,
            march = 60 ,
            april = march + 31-1 
            may = april + 
            june 30 
            july 31
            september 30
            october 31
