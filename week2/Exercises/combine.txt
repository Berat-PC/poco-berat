Then the program should ask for the two numbers and print the result.


Variables   NUMBER1,

            sumOfNrs,
            subResult;
Display : " Which operation you want to use? ADD or SUBTRACT?"

IF User chooses ADD
    1.  Prompt "You have chosen Add; Please enter the first number."

        ELSE display "Invalid Character! Please enter only number." then send the user to the step 3
    4.  Get NUMBER2 as second input and store

            sumOfNrs = NUMBER1 + NUMBER2


            Display "Result = " + sumOfNrs


IF User chooses SUBTRACTION
    1.  Prompt "You have chosen Subtract; Please enter the first number."
    Check the input

    4.  Get NUMBER2 as second input and store

            subResult = NUMBER1 - NUMBER2


            Display "Result = " + subResult;
