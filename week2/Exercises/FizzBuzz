Ex. 3.2.1 (**) - FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
** for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the
number and 
** for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
** For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".


Variables 
                fizz = counter%3 is equal to "0"
                buzz = counter%5 is equal to "0"
            fizzBuzz = both counter%3 and counter%5 are equal to "0"
            counter  = 0

    COMPUTER starts to count from 0 to 100. While counting , each number will be named as counter.
    
    If counter is equal to 0 after both divided by 3 and at the same time 5
    Display fizzBuzz and continue counting
    
    Else If counter is equal to 0 after divided by 3
    Display fizz and continue counting
    
    Else If counter is equal to 0 after divided by 5
    Display buzz and continue counting

    ELSE 
    Display the number's itself.
