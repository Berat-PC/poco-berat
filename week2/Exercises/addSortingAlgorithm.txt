EXERCISE 1
Allow the user to input digits, afterwards sort and print them in
numerical order.

-- I collect numbers from the user with some rules
    - Max. 10 numbers can be entered
    - 1 number at a time
    - numbers will be integer without decimals

-- After getting all 
    I pick the numbers from my list by putting on the table. When I pick the number and see 
    what nr it is, I check the ones on the table to define where should I put the new nr.

    for example numbers are ( 15 20 35 11 2 8  )
    Imagine I already picked 35 and 2. I put them by starting from left as shown below

    2 , 35 

    then I pick again a nr. I picked 8.
    Now I check my list from left and If my number is smaller
    than 2 or now ? If it is true I put there. If not I pass the number 2 and 
    check the next number. I repeat the same condition above and my number will be smaller
    than 35 so I will place my new number(8) just before the 35.
